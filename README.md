reference locking for amateur radio communications devices

Uses ADF4153 fractional N synthesiser to deal with very low highest-common-factors such as locking a FT-1000  10.485760 MHz to 10MHz.

Tiny form factor - maintains same form factor as XREF product 13.6 x 29.1mm

All components machine loaded. 107 parts , over two sides on 4 layer PCB.

Ample solder-blob jumpers to deal with input options.

8-15V input

USB interface for programming and configuration.

free run of existing TCXO when external provided reference not present

LED multi status indicator . 

Handles variety of internal reference amplitudes with on board amplifier for  < 100 MHz inputs . 

Requires >= +2dBm reference input  10  to 150 MHz (10 MHz nominal) 

Low Z control output able to pull power supplies as well as VCXO inputs. 

Low loop filter BW preserves existing internal reference noise performance and excludes fractional spurs.
